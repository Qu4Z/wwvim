Using WikiWikiVim					  *wwvim* *wikiwikivim*

1. Getting Started			|wwvim-starting|
2. Usage				|wwvim-usage|

==============================================================================
1. Getting Started					     *wwvim-starting*

To create a new wiki, make a directory anywhere. Inside this, create a file 
called index.wiki. Open it. 

This is your home entry. (It may be called anything; index is the convention)

Type the following into it, then save:
>
	This is the home-entry of my wiki.

	I can go to AnotherWikiPage from here.
<
Now position your cursor over the text AnotherWikiPage and press Enter.

wwvim will take you to the wiki entry for AnotherWikiPage. Edit this to your 
heart's content, save, and press Ctrl-O. Ctrl-O takes you back to previous 
locations. If you've moved around AnotherWikiPage a lot, you may have to press 
it multiple times. Soon you'll be back on the index page.

Congratulations! You've just made your own personal wiki. 

==============================================================================
2. Usage							*wwvim-usage*

When editing a .wiki file, any WikiWords are automatically converted into
links. Pressing <CR> on one will take you to that wiki entry. 

If an entry does not exist, it will be created.

Use Ctrl-O/Ctrl-I to go back and forth between entries (see also |jumplist|)
Note that by default you can't jump away from unsaved changes (see |hidden|)

You can also use Ctrl-] (go to tag) to go to a wiki entry.

There is no change tracking built in -- use git or hg (or darcs or svn or ...)

wwvim supports inter-wiki links. If you open a symlink to a page on another 
wiki wwvim will switch to browsing that wiki, starting on the page specified. 
For instance, if you execute
>
	ln -s ../anotherwiki/index.wiki theotherwiki.wiki
<
any references to TheOtherWiki will become links to the index of that wiki,
working as expected. 

wwvim does not specify a format for your entries. I use plaintext, but one 
could also use markdown or a number of other excellent solutions. 
Unfortunately, wwvim currently relies on the filetype being set to wiki, 
which breaks markdown syntax highlighting. This will hopefully be fixed in a 
future version.

For a more "complete" implementation of personal wikis in vim, consider 
vimwiki (https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
